# Yen's K-Shortest Paths Algorithm

## Introduction

Implemented Yen's Algorithm to find K shortest paths in space-time graphs derived from time-varying graphs, based on research paper.
Yen's algorithm is a classical algorithm used to find the \( k \)-shortest paths in a weighted graph. This algorithm finds not just the shortest path, but the second shortest, third shortest, and so on, up to the \( k \)-th shortest path.

## Features

- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Finds multiple paths in a weighted graph.
- **Versatile**: Can be applied to various types of graphs, including directed and undirected.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to specify the number of shortest paths to find.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library
